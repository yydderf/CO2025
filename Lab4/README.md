# Lab4 Advance Pipeline CPU
[Spec PPT](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u4HHOnhiRpMQ4MSvgmBwmsSVQCp0DqdDcTU2YcJIJeM/edit?usp=sharing)
## Introduction
We have pipelined our CPU to improve performance. However, there are three significant issues that stay unsolved. They are branches, load-use, and write-use hazards. In this lab, you are requested to implement hazard detection and forwarding units.

## Lab Source Code
As for other modules, TAs think you should finish lab4 based on your lab3 submission, so there is no template.

# Pipeline Cycle CPU (with hazard & forwarding)

## Reference Architecture
As long as it works successfully, it is not necessary to implement it according to the architecture diagram.

## Hazard Dectection Unit
The hazard detection unit is responsible for inserting a nop when load-use data hazard happens (as the following snippet)
```assembly
ld x1 0(sp);
; insert nop here 
add x1 x1 x2;
```
Also, flush the pipeline register after branch instruction once the branch is taken.
- If you follow the architecture provided above
    - You must determine if the branch will take or not in the ID stage.


## Forwarding Unit
The forwarding unit deals with write-use data hazards; your design should handle the following case.
```assembly
add x1, x1, x2
add x1, x1, x3
add x1, x1, x4
```

## Instruction
Your CPU should be able to support the following RISC-V ISA.
- add, addi, sub, and, andi, or, ori
- slt, slti
- lw, sw, beq
- jal, jalr, bne, blt, bge

## Requirement
Implement hazard detection and forwarding units, then integrate them into your CPU. You are recommended to write the assembly yourself to test your design's correctness.

TAs have prepared hidden test cases to grade your design. We will verify correctness by comparing register values. Your design should also be able to satisfy previous (lab1~3) requirements.

## Submission
Please submit your source code as a zip file to **E3**.

The name of the zip file should be <student_id>.zip, and the structure of the file should be as the following:

```
<stduent_id>.zip
    |- <student_id>/
        |- ...(your source codes)
```

## Hint
- Be mindful of data hazards that may occur with branch instructions.
- Read the textbook first and understand each submodule's functionality.
- Debugging with waveform makes your life easier.
- Try to generate your risc-v machine code with Ripe; you can write a simple assembly to verify if your code runs as expected.
