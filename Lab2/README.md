# Lab2: Single Cycle CPU

## Introduction

In Lab2, you are tasked with implementing a Single Cycle CPU based on the RISC-V ISA. Upon completing this lab, you should have a deeper understanding of CPU architecture and the RISC-V instruction set.

Don't panic! This lab is not as difficult as it might seem. To successfully implement the RISC-V CPU, we encourage you to study the functionality of each component and understand how they cooperate. We will also introduce a useful RISC-V simulator, Ripes, which demonstrates the CPU workflow step by step.

## Lab Source Code

The TAs have prepared a [template](https://github.com/nycu-caslab/CO2025/tree/main/Lab2) for you. You can follow the template or modify it as needed. However, there are certain elements you should not change:

- Registers
- Instruction Memory
- Data Memory
- CPU I/O interface and register instance names

In the provided source code, we include a simple instruction file, `TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`, containing machine code generated from `TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.asm`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `rst` signal is active low, which means the module will reset when the `rst` signal is set to zero. You should follow this design in your implementation.

## Ripes

[Ripes](https://ripes.me/) is a visual computer architecture simulator and assembly code editor designed for the RISC-V instruction set architecture.

![ripes1](https://nycu-caslab.github.io/CO2025_Web/_images/ripes1.png)

As shown in the picture above, you can write your own assembly code, clock the processor, and verify the register values.

You can copy the generated machine code into `TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` in the following format to run your code on your CPU design. Each line in the file should contain 8 bits. A single 4-byte instruction is represented by 4 lines, and the file should end with a new empty line.

```asm
addi t2 zero 20
jalr ra (t2)0
addi t0 zero 1
addi t0 t0 1
addi t0 t0 1
addi t1 zero 100
```

```

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you change the settings in Ripes to match the constraints of the register values specified for this lab.

- jalr  
  `jalr` stores `pc+4` in `regs[rd]`, exectues `pc = regs[rs1] + imm`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All operations are signed. You must follow this ISA table to implement your instructions:

## Requirements

Implement your RISC-V single-cycle CPU. Your CPU should support the following RISC-V ISA instructions:

- Arithmetic and Logical Operations: `add`, `addi`, `sub`, `and`, `andi`, `or`, `ori`, `slt`, `slti`
- Memory Operations: `lw`, `sw`
- Branch Operations: `beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`
- Jump Operations: `jal`, `jalr`

TAs have prepared a Verilator testbench and some `TEST_INSTRUCTION.txt` files to grade your design. The correctness will be verified by comparing the register values.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not modify the register, instruction memory, or CPU I/O interface; otherwise, you will receive 0 points.

## Scoring Criteria
- Basic Test: 20%
- Hidden Test: 40%
- Fibonacci Test: 40%

## Hints

- Read the textbook first to understand each submodule's functionality.
- Use waveform debugging to simplify the debugging process.
- Try generating your own RISC-V machine code using Ripes. You can write simple assembly code to verify if your implementation works as expected.
